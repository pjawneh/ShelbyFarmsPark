Shelby Farms Park - Android App (Unoffical) Redesign

Shelby Farms is the largest city park in Memphis,TN at about 4,500 acres. The park is known for its trails,namely, the Greenline which runs through several parts of the city. Activities at park include biking, running, hiking, fishing, and more.

With the park recently renovated, I thought the android app could use a material design refresh. This project was aimed at active and new park visitors. The app creates a familiar and inviting user experience using the park's brand guidelines and imagery.
